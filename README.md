Hi! I'm Jared, a coffee lover, rock climber, electronic music enthusiast, and software engineer.

My focus the past few years has been on machine learning, artificial intelligence, and self-driving cars. In the summer of 2017 cofounded a project called AI Or Die, where we build combat robots that fight autonomously.

In my current occupation, I write planning and control software for autonomous vehicles at a startup in Palo Alto called Cyngn. 
This blog has no reason or purpose. I have no intention of making regular posts.
